This is a financial calculator system, completed in Java, that includes three different calculators for three different purposes, with interest compounded:
The first calculator is a mortgage calculator, and will calculate the monthly payment of a loan, and total interest paid over the life of the loan.
The second calculator is a future value calculator that calculates the future value and interest accrued of a one time deposit, in a given number of years.
The third calculator is a present value calculator that will calculate for you how much you need to invest today to fund an annuity that pays off.
