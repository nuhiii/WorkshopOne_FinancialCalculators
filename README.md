This is a financial calculator system, completed in Java, that includes three different calculators for three different purposes, with interest compounded:
The first calculator is a mortgage calculator, and will calculate the monthly payment of a loan, and total interest paid over the life of the loan.
The second calculator is a future value calculator that calculates the future value and interest accrued of a one time deposit, in a given number of years.
The third calculator is a present value calculator that will calculate for you how much you need to invest today to fund an annuity that pays off.

This system is also equipped with handling user input errors.

Last but not least, one interest piece of code I incorporated was the Decimal Formatter:
DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat("#,###.00");
This line will format numbers with their appropriate commas, and decimal points, and is extremely handy for dealing with money past the thousand mark.
